        This document shall explain the external view of the globus xio
        architecture.  To see an explanation of the data types used to 
        implement the system see <I>Internal arch</I>
        Globus XIO is broken down into two main components, famework and
        drivers.  The following picture illustrates the architecture:

        <H3>Globus XIO Framework</H3>
        <P>
        The Globus XIO framework manages io operation requests that an 
        application makes via the user api @ref.  The framework does no 
        work to deliver the data in an io operation nor does it manipulate 
        the data.  All of that work is done by the drivers.  The frameworks
        job is to manage requests and map them to the drivers interface.
        It is the drivers themselves that are reposnsible for manipulating
        and transporting the data.
        <BR>
        <H3>Drivers</H3>
        <P>
        A driver is the component of globus xio that is responsible for 
        manipulating and transporting the users data.  There are two types
        of drivers, transform and transport. Transform drivers are those that
        manipulate the data buffers passed to it via the user api and the
        xio framework.  Transform drivers are those that are capable of
        sending the data over a wire.
        <BR><BR>
        Drivers are grouped into stacks, that is of course one driver on 
        top of another.  When an io operation is requested the globus xio
        framwork passes the operation request to every driver in the order
        they are in the stack.  When the bottom level driver 
        (the transport driver) finishes shipping the data, it passes the
        data request back to the xio framework.  Globus xio will then
        deliver the request back up the stack in this manner until it
        reaches the top, at which point the application will be notified 
        that there request is completed.
        <BR><BR>
        In a driver stack there can only be one 
        transport driver.  The reason for this is simple. The transport
        driver is the one responsible for sending or receiving the data.
        Once this type of operation is preformmed it makes no sense to 
        pass the request down a stack, rather it is time to pass the 
        request back up. [totally unclear].
        <BR>
        There can be many transform drivers in any given driver stack.
        A transform driver is one that can manipulate the reuest operations
        as the pass.  Some good examples of transport drivers are security
        wrappers and compression.  However a transport driver can also be one 
        that adds additional protocol.  For example a stack could consist of
        a TCP transport driver and an HTTP transform driver.  The HTTP driver 
        would be responsible for marshalling the HTTP protocol and the TCP
        driver would be responsible for shipping that protocol over the wire.
