        <P>
        Read this page at your own risk.  I am adding doc to this as i 
        mold the code.  For the time bieng it will not flow well and will
        look a lot like source code documentation (guess why).

        When designing globus_xio extreme care has been taken to provide an 
        efficient system.  When creating a extensible flexible runtime system
        it is often the case that efficiency must be sacrificed.  This is not
        the case with globus_xio.  The arcitecture of globus_xio is described
        here.

        <PRE>
/*
 *  used by: handle, and target, operation
 *
 *  lifecycle
 *  ---------
 *  When created by target it lives as long as the target does.  Essentially
 *  The user stack is converted into this structure and maintained by the 
 *  target.  Ass soon and the target is destroyed the driver stack is
 *  destroyed.
 *
 *  When used by the handle it is "created" on open from a target (the one in
 *  target is simply reused).  When the handle is destroyed this adt is 
 *  destroyed with it.
 *
 *  Operations simply reference the driver stack maintained by the handle. 
 *  Operations are only allowed to live as long as the handle from which they 
 *  came, so there is no reference counting needed here.
 *
 *  Not all members are used by target.
