        <BR>
        When designing globus_xio extreme care has been taken to provide an 
        efficient system.  When creating a extensible flexible runtime system
        it is often the case that efficiency must be sacrificed.  This is not
        the case with globus_xio.  The arcitecture of globus_xio is described
        here.
