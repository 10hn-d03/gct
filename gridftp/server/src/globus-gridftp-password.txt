NAME
----
globus-gridftp-password - creates an encrypted password to be used for
an user of the Globus GridFTP server

SYNOPSYS
--------
globus-gridftp-password

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Create encrypted user passwords to be used with the GridFTP server in
case it is configured to use clear text password. However, this type
of functionality is not recommended, unless the network is trusted.

The *globus-gridftp-password* command asks for a password and
generates a line in the same format as the standard password file (see
file */etc/passwd*). Such a line can be appended to the password file
used by the GridFTP server.

EXAMPLE
-------
    % globus-gridftp-password >> pwfile
    Password:

Generates a password line for the current user and append it to file "pwfile".
