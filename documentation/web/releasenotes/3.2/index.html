      <h2><A name=CAS>CAS</A></h2>
      <p> Included in the GT 3.2  release is the first production release
        of the Community Authorization Service (CAS). CAS
        is an authorization system that allows for fine-grain (e.g. per file)
        access control of Grid Resources. GT 3.2 beta includes the CAS Grid Service,
        which allows for creating and administering rights, client tools and
        libraries for using CAS, and a CAS-enabled GridFTP service. More information
      on CAS can be found <a href="http://www.globus.org/Security/CAS/GT3/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>        This version of CAS uses the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language
        (SAML) standard. Users should be aware that RSA Security has identified
        four patents it believes could be relevant to implementing certain
        operational modes of the SAML specifications. The Globus Alliance has
        established a license agreement with RSA covering usage of SAML in
        the Globus Toolkit, however users who redistribute SAML-enabled portions
        of the Globus Toolkit or use SAML-enabled portions in their own applications
        should understand the issue and may want to obtain a royalty-free license
      from RSA. </p>
      <p>        For information regarding the patent claims and a royalty-free reciprocal
        license to the patents, see: <br>

	       <h2><A name=GridFTP>GridFTP</A></h2>
      The Globus Toolkit wuftpd-based 
      GridFTP server, its associated tools, and libraries in the 3.2  
      release contain important bug fixes and improvements on existing 
      functionality.&nbsp;
      <p>Improvements include support for platform 
      independent, machine parseable, file info (MLST and MLSD commands), a new 
      checksum command (<font face="Courier New" size="2">cksm</font>), support for the Unix 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">chmod</font> command, and support 
      for file globbing and directory moves, i.e. 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> is no longer 
      restricted to a single file. <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> also now has command line 
      options for all the equivalent client library functionality. </p>

              <h2><A name=RFT>RFT</A></h2>
      <p>The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service 
      component in the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended 
      functionality. In particular, this version of RFT supports recursive directory
      copy between GridFTP servers that support MLSD/MLST features. </p>
		<p>The schemas of the service have been reworked 
      which increased the scalability of service significantly. </p>
	  <p>A new service instance level option has been added that turns on data channel reuse if 
      your request consists of multiple transfers between same hosts which will 
      further enhance performance. </p>
	<p>A new command line client has been added, 
      which in addition to being able to submit transfer requests to service, 
      can also serve as notification sink. This allows one to display number of 
      transfers done/failed etc. </p>

      <h2><A name=RLS>RLS</A></h2>
     <p>The Replica Location Service (RLS) component in 
      the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended functionality.
				In 
      particular, this version of RLS supports the 
      deployment of a hierarchy of Replica Location Index (RLI) nodes. </p>
		<p>In past RLS versions, RLIs summarized mapping information from one or more Local 
      Replica Catalog (LRC) nodes.
				In the new version, an RLS can be configured 
      with an arbitrary hierarchy of RLI nodes, where each RLI summarizes state
      information for one or more lower-level LRC and/or RLI nodes. </p>
		<p>In addition, the following have been fixed:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Memory leak when LRC or RLI is updating RLIs that have been down for 
		extended periods</li>
		<li>Args reversed when limiting results when not using MySQL</li>
		<li>Typo in SQL that retrieves attribute values</li>
		<li>Bug 
		<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1495">1495</a> (typos in the code)</li>
		<li>Inconsistencies with <font face="Courier New" size="2">pkgdata</font>
		</li>
		<li>RLS hang when started up as RLI only</li>
		<li>Java API inconsistency (<font face="Courier New" size="2">RLSClient.RLI.rliList</font> 
		has been added)</li>
		<li>Packaging metadata</li>

      <h2><A name=XIO>XIO</A></h2>
      <p>Globus XIO is an extensible input/output 
      library for the Globus Toolkit®. For this and future releases of the 
      Globus Toolkit the <code>globus_xio</code> library will provide all input and output 
      functionality for the C code. </p>
		<p>Globus XIO will replace the <code>globus_io</code> 
      library. A portability layer is included with the release so legacy 
      applications written to <code>globus_io</code> will be supported; however it is 
      recommended that future applications code straight to the 
		<code>globus_xio</code> API. </p>

      <h2><A name=GRAM>GRAM</A></h2>
		
			<p>The Globus Toolkit Grid Services GRAM component in the GT 3.2  release
			   contains many important bug fixes and improvements on existing
		functionality.</p>
			<p><strong>Improvements: </strong></p>
		    <ul>
              <li>For the web service (WS) Managed Job Service ( <strong>MJS </strong>),
                we improved the following: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Faults are more easily internationalized. <br>
          <li>The local scheduler scripts provide better error messages. <br>
          <li>Instances are deactivated during periods of inactivity in order
            to increase scalability by reducing memory consumption. </li>
        </ul>
              </li>
      </ul>
		    <ul>
              <li>For the pre-WS JobManager, we applied a patch for bug <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=802">802 </a> which
                enables an alternate method for job status detection for a user
                (this is used in Condor-G). <br>
              <li>For both WS MJS and pre-WS JobManager, the local scheduler
                scripts <br>
    have been improved to reduce the chance of errors due to NFS caching delays
    and increase scalability by reducing memory consumption. <br>
              <li>The WS GRAM components are now IPV6 compliant. <br>
              <li>For the managed-job-globusrun program, we added these options: <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The -deleg [full | limited] option indicates limited
                      or full proxy delegation. <br>
                    <li>The -proxy [ &lt;file path&gt;] option selects
                      credentials to use for authentication. </li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
      </ul>
		    <p><strong>Important bug fixes: </strong></p>
		    <ul>
              <li>For the WS MJS, we fixed: <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>UHE GRIM credential lifetime to obey user configuration. <br>
                    <li>job recovery problems. <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              <li>For the WS GRAM compontents, we fixed UHE recovery and automatic
                shutdown (due to inactivity) </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><A name=Information_Services>Index Services (formerly known as MDS)</A></h2>
      <p>The GT 3.2  release of the Index Services components contains
        bug fixes, performance and stability improvements, and a few new features.
        There has also been considerable reworking of Service Data Aggregation
        concepts into a component-based API to allow for a more flexible model
        handling multiple data aggregation strategies. As a result of these changes,
        the Index Service (and other services that incorporate the Aggregator
        components) can now aggregate service data from other services by using
      the ServiceGroup registration interfaces.</p>

        <h2><A name=CB>C Bindings</A></h2>
      <p>The C Bindings component of the GT 3.2 release contains bug fixes,
      as well as added support for big numbers using the <code>xsd:integer </code> type. </p>
      <p>Since GT 3.0.x, a number of important bug fixes have been made, including fixes
for the <code>gt3_gram_client</code> library for multiple job submission,as well as a number
of fixes to memory handling in that library. </p>
      <p>Also, support for the Tru64 native compiler
  was improved.</p>

      <h2><A name=TP>OGSA-DAI (Tech Preview)</A></h2>
      <p> Included in the GT 3.2  release is a tech preview of the Open Grid
        Services Architecture - Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI)
        software. OGSA-DAI aims to provide uniform methods for discovering, accessing
        and integrating heterogeneous data resources, primarily databases, on
        the Grid. An extensible activity framework allows developers to build
        project specific functionality in addition to the standard querying,
        database management, data delivery, transformation and compression activities
      provided. </p>

      <p>Officially supported databases are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MySQL 3.2.x / 4.0.x
        <li>DB2 8
        <li>Oracle 9
        <li>Xindice 1.0 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally - though not officially supported - most databases with
        JDBC, ODBC or XML:DB interfaces which support the SQL or XPath query
        languages can be published using OGSA-DAI. Supported data delivery methods
        include SOAP, GridFTP and HTTP(S) streams. </p>
      <p>New features for this release of OGSA-DAI (r3.1.1) include full message-level security support, a technical preview of the Java Client Toolkit
        API (to aid development of applications using OGSA-DAI), and prototypes
      of CSV and BinX file access functionality.</p>
