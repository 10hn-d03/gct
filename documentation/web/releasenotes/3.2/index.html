      The Globus Toolkit Grid 
      Services Core component released in the 3.2  release contains 
      important bug fixes and improvements on existing functionality. Changes
      include better deactivate semantics, a change in the persistent grid service
      programming model, changes to the security descriptor format, updated third
      party jars and more.<br>
		<br>
		Further information can be found in the 
      <A href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.2beta/core_notes.html">Core 
      release notes</A>. &nbsp;

      <h2><A name=Security>Security (GSI)</A></h2>
      The Globus Toolkit 
		Security component shipped in 3.2  contains a slew of bug fixes and 
		various improvements. Improvements of note are updated third party 
		libraries, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support in Java, support
      for pluggable authorization in the GridFTP and GT2 GRAM components, SimpleCA
      and improved documentation. Also, the security component will no longer
      ship with the Globus CA certificate. Users requiring certificates for testing
      should take a look at the 
		<a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs/index.html">Globus Certificate 
		Service</a> or <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/simple-ca.html">Simple CA</a>. <br>

      </p>      <h2><A name=GridFTP>GridFTP</A></h2>
      The Globus Toolkit wuftpd-based 
      GridFTP server, its associated tools, and libraries in the 3.2  
      release contain important bug fixes and improvements on existing 
      functionality.&nbsp;
      <p>Improvements include support for platform 
      independent, machine parseable, file info (MLST and MLSD commands), a new 
      checksum command (<font face="Courier New" size="2">cksm</font>), support for the Unix 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">chmod</font> command, and support 
      for file globbing and directory moves, i.e. 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> is no longer 
      restricted to a single file. <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus-url-copy</font> also now has command line 
      options for all the equivalent client library functionality. <br>
		<BR>
		There is 
      also a new, non-wuftpd based implementation of the GridFTP server 
      available. It is in the early stages of development and lacks 
      many of the features, but it will give people a first look at the new 
      server and its architecture.<br>

      <h2><A name=XIO>XIO</A></h2>
      Globus XIO is an extensible input/output 
      library for the Globus Toolkit®. For this and future releases of the 
      Globus Toolkit the <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus_xio</font> library will provide all input and output 
      functionality for the C code. <br>
		<BR>Globus XIO will replace the <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus_io</font> 
      library.&nbsp; A portability layer is included with the release so legacy 
      applications written to <font face="Courier New" size="2">globus_io</font> will be supported; however it is 
      recommended that future applications code straight to the 
		<font face="Courier New" size="2">globus_xio</font> API.

			<p>The Globus Toolkit Grid Services GRAM component in the GT 3.2  release
			   contains many important bug fixes and improvements on existing
		functionality.</p>
			<p><b>Improvements:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>For the GT3 Managed Job Service (<b>MJS</b>), we improved the following:<br>
			</li>
			&nbsp;<ul><li>Faults are more easily
		internationalized.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>The local scheduler scripts provide better error messages.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Instances are deactivated during periods of
		inactivity in order to increase scalability by reducing memory
		consumption caching delays and increase scalability by reducing memory 
		consumption.</li></ul>
			
					

		
</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>For the GT2 JobManager, we applied a patch for bug 
			<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=802">802</a> which enables an 
		alternate method for job status detection for a user (this is used in 
			Condor-G).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>For both GT3 MJS and GT2 JobManager, the local scheduler scripts
			<br>
			have been improved to reduce the chance of errors due to NFS.<br>
&nbsp;<li>For the GT3 GRAM component, service is now IPV6 compliant.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>For the GT3 <font face="Courier New" size="2">managed-job-globusrun</font> program, we added these 
			options:</li>
			<br>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The <font face="Courier New" size="2">-deleg [full | limited]</font> option 
			indicates limited or
		full proxy delegation.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>The&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">-proxy [ &lt;file path&gt;]</font> option selects credentials to
		use for authentication.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Important bug fixes:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>For the GT3 MJS, we fixed:</li>
		<br>
&nbsp;<ul><li>UHE GRIM credential lifetime to obey user configuration.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>job recovery problems.<br>
&nbsp;</li></ul>
		
		<li>For the GT3 GRAM, we fixed UHE recovery and automatic shutdown (due 
		to inactivity)</li>

      Included in the GT 3.2  release is the 
		second 
      production release of the Community Authorization Service (<b>CAS</b>).
      CAS is an authorization system that allows for fine-grain (e.g. per file)
      access control of Grid Resources. GT 3.2 includes the CAS Grid Service,
      which allows for creating and administering rights, client tools and libraries
      for using CAS, and a CAS-enabled GridFTP service (other CAS-enabled services
      are expected in the 3.4 release). More information on CAS can be found <A 
      href="http://www.globus.org/Security/CAS/GT3/">here</A>. <BR>
      <br>
				This version 
      of CAS uses the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard. 
      Users should be aware that RSA Security has identified four patents it 
      believes could be relevant to implementing certain operational modes of the 
      SAML specifications. The Globus Alliance has established a license 
      agreement with RSA covering usage of SAML in the Globus Toolkit, however 
      users who redistribute SAML-enabled portions of the Globus Toolkit or use 
      SAML-enabled portions in their own applications should understand the 
      issue and may want to obtain a royalty-free license from RSA. <br>

      </p>        <h2><A name=Information_Services>Information Services (MDS)</A></h2>
      <p>The GT 3.2  release of the Information Services components contains
        bug fixes, performance and stability improvements, and a few new features.
        There has also been considerable reworking of Service Data Aggregation
        concepts into a component-based API to allow for a more flexible model
        handling multiple data aggregation strategies. As a result of these changes,
        the Index Service (and other services that incorporate the Aggregator
        components) can now aggregate service data from other services by using
      the ServiceGroup registration interfaces.</p>

      The Reliable File Transfer Service 
      component in the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended 
      functionality. In particular, this version of Reliable File Transfer 
      Service supports recursive directory copy between GridFTP servers that
       support MLSD/MLST features. <br>
		<br>
				The schemas of the service have been reworked 
      which increased the scalability of service significantly. <br>
		<br>
				A new service 
      instance level option has been added that turns on data channel reuse if 
      your request consists of multiple transfers between same hosts which will 
      further enhance performance. <br>
		<br>
				A new command line client has been added, 
      which in addition to being able to submit transfer requests to service, 
      can also serve as notification sink. This allows one to display number of 
      transfers done/failed etc. <br>

      The Replica Location Service (<b>RLS</b>) component in 
      the GT 3.2  release contains bug fixes and extended functionality.
				In 
      particular, this version of RLS supports the 
      deployment of a hierarchy of Replica Location Index (<b>RLI</b>) nodes. 
		<br>
		<br>In past RLS versions, RLIs summarized mapping information from one or more Local 
      Replica Catalog (<b>LRC</b>) nodes.
				In the new version, an RLS can be configured 
      with an arbitrary hierarchy of RLI nodes, where each RLI summarizes state 
      information for one or more lower-level LRC and/or RLI nodes. <br><br>
		In addition, the following have been fixed:<ul>
		<li>Memory leak when LRC or RLI is updating RLIs that have been down for 
		extended periods</li>
		<li>Args reversed when limiting results when not using MySQL</li>
		<li>Typo in SQL that retrieves attribute values</li>
		<li>Bug 
		<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1495">1495</a> (typos in the code)</li>
		<li>Inconsistencies with <font face="Courier New" size="2">pkgdata</font>
		</li>
		<li>RLS hang when started up as RLI only</li>
		<li>Java API inconsistency (<font face="Courier New" size="2">RLSClient.RLI.rliList</font> 
		has been added)</li>
		<li>Packaging metadata</li>

      </p>        <h2><A name=CB>C Bindings</A></h2>
      The C Bindings component of the 
      GT 3.2  release contains a number of bug fixes. No new 
      functionality was included in this release. Important bug fixes include
      fixes for the <font face="Courier New" size="2">gt3_gram_client</font> library for multiple job submission, as well as 
      a number of fixes to memory handling in that library. Also, support for 
      Tru64 native compiler was improved. 
      <p align="right"><a href="#core">Top</a><BR>
      </p>        <h2><A name=TP>OGSA-DAI (Tech Preview)</A></h2>
      <p> Included in the GT 3.2 
		 release is a tech preview of the Open Grid Services Architecture - Data
        Access and Integration (<b>OGSA-DAI</b>) software. OGSA-DAI aims to provide uniform methods for discovering, accessing and integrating heterogeneous data resources, primarily databases, on the Grid. An extensible activity framework allows developers to build project specific functionality in addition to the standard querying, database management, data delivery, transformation and compression activities provided.
</p>

<p>
Officially supported databases are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> MySQL 3.2.x / 4.0.x
<li> DB2 8
<li> Oracle 9
<li> Xindice 1.0
</ul>

<p>
Additionally - though not officially supported - most databases with JDBC, ODBC or XML:DB interfaces which support the SQL or XPath query languages can be published using OGSA-DAI. Supported data delivery methods include SOAP, GridFTP and HTTP(S) streams.
</p>

<p>
New features for this release of OGSA-DAI (r3.1.1) include full message level security support, a technical preview of the Java Client Toolkit API (to aid development of applications using OGSA-DAI), and prototypes of CSV and BinX file access functionality.
<br>
