    <h1>Globus Toolkit&reg; 3.2  GSI Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Improvements/Bug Details </h2>
<ul>
  <li>CRL Support for Java GSI libraries
  <li>Support for authorization callouts. These callouts can be used to replace
      gridmap based authorization/mapping and to enforce finer grained authorization
      in the GT2 GRAM component. More information can be found <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/security/callouts/">here </a>
  <li>OpenSSL has been upgraded to version 0.9.7. If you have DNs in your grid-mapfile
      that contain a USERID component, you will need to update these (see <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=575">bug
      575 for details) </a>
  <li>grid-proxy-init now checks that the certificate and the private key match
  <li>CRL checking for C GSI libraries now handles the lastUpdate field and
      no longer assumes that the nextUpdate field is always present, which means
      that CRLs without a nextUpdate field no longer cause an error and don't
      expire.
  <li>The SimpleCA packages are now included in the standard distribution
  <li>The Globus CA setup package is now no longer part of the distribution.
      Users requiring certificates for testing should take a look at the <a href="http://gcs.globus.org:8080/gcs">Globus
      Certificate Service </a> or Simple CA. <strong>Note that you will not be
      able to run grid-cert-request until you have installed a CA setup package </strong>.
  <li>CA setup packages (GCS and SimpleCA) are now non-interactive.
  <li>grid-cert-renew has been removed from the distribution
  <li>For grid services specific security changes please see the <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/3.2beta/core_notes.html">core
        release notes </a>
  <li>The grid-default-ca utility has been added to the distribution
  <li>Various minor API changes have been made (Proxy Core, Cert Utils, System
      Config)
  <li>Fixed bugs 590, 978, 982, 1018, 1028, 1091, 1126, 1143, 1151, 1171, 1304,
      1308 </li>
</ul>
