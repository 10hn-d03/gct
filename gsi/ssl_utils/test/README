Security/tests/README

Configure globus --with-security-tests to build these tests.

gss-client and gss-server come from the MIT Kerberos 5 distribution.

gss-assist-client currently doesn't work.

test-client-cert and test-server-cert are certificates for testing
signed by a bogus CA whose cert is in test-certdir. Currently the
actual CA key is on my desktop machine, which is ok since the
testing stuff is the only thing that uses this CA so it can be
easily replaced.
