# entries have the format
#  <package name>  <package dir> <template file>
#
#  package name:  Any label; will most likely actually match a package's name
#  package dir:   The is the dir you want the template file to appear in.
#     This will normally be in the package's root dir (along side bootstrap)
#     The path must be relative to CVSROOT and NOT end with a '/'
#  template file: The template file to put in the package's root.  The
#     strings @PMT_TIMESTAMP@ and @PMT_BRANCH_ID@ will be substituted for the
#     correct values.  This template file must reside in the pmt dir
#
#  Note, this is not limitted to packages.  Anywhere you want a parsed template
#    file to appear you may add an entry for here.  
#
#  template files are maintained for modifications in all dirs below
#  - a current limitation is that none of the paths listed here can overlap
