.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
program constructs a job description from its command\-line options and then submits the job to the GRAM service running at
\fISERVICE_CONTACT\fR\&. The executable and arguments to the executable are provided on the command\-line after all other options\&. Note that the
\fB\-dumprsl\fR,
\fB\-dryrun\fR,
\fB\-verify\fR, and
\fB\-file\fR
command\-line options must occur before the first non\-option argument, the
\fISERVICE_CONTACT\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
provides similar functionality to
\fBglobusrun\fR
in that it allows interactive start\-up of GRAM jobs\&. However, unlike
\fBglobusrun\fR, it uses command\-line parameters to define the job instead of RSL expressions\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The full set of options to
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
are:
.PP
\-help | \-usage
.RS 4
Display a help message to standard error and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-version
.RS 4
Display the software version of the
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
program to standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-version
.RS 4
Display the software version of the
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
program including DiRT information to standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-dumprsl
.RS 4
Translate the command\-line options to
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
into an RSL expression that can be used with tools such as
\fBglobusrun\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-dryrun
.RS 4
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the
dryrun
option enabled\&. When this option is used, the GRAM service prepares to execute the job but stops before submitting the job to the LRM\&. This can be used to diagnose some problems such as missing files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-verify
.RS 4
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the
dryrun
option enabled and then without it enabled if the dryrun is successful\&.
.RE
.PP
\-file \fIARGUMENT_FILE\fR
.RS 4
Read additional command\-line options from
\fIARGUMENT_FILE\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-np \fIPROCESSES\fR | \-count \fIPROCESSES\fR
.RS 4
Start
\fIPROCESSES\fR
instances of the executable as a single job\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m \fIMAX_TIME\fR | \-maxtime \fIMAX_TIME\fR
.RS 4
Schedule the job to run for a maximum of
\fIMAX_TIME\fR
minutes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIPROJECT\fR | \-project \fIPROJECT\fR
.RS 4
Request that the job use the allocation
\fIPROJECT\fR
when submitting the job to the LRM\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q \fIQUEUE\fR | \-queue \fIQUEUE\fR
.RS 4
Request that the job be submitted to the LRM using the named
\fIQUEUE\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d \fIDIRECTORY\fR | \-directory \fIDIRECTORY\fR
.RS 4
Run the job in the directory named by
\fIDIRECTORY\fR\&. Input and output files will be interpreted relative to this directory\&. This directory must exist on the file system on the LRM\-managed resource\&. If not specified, the job will run in the home directory of the user the job is running as\&.
.RE
.PP
\-env \fINAME\fR=\fIVALUE\fR
.RS 4
Define an environment variable named by
\fINAME\fR
with the value
\fIVALUE\fR
in the job environment\&. This option may be specified multiple times to define multiple environment variables\&.
.RE
.PP
\-stdin [\-l | \-s] \fISTDIN_FILE\fR
.RS 4
Use the file named by
\fISTDIN_FILE\fR
as the standard input of the job\&. If the
\fB\-l\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the
\fB\-s\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-stdout [\-l | \-s] \fISTDOUT_FILE\fR
.RS 4
Use the file named by
\fISTDOUT_FILE\fR
as the destination for the standard output of the job\&. If the
\fB\-l\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the
\fB\-s\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-stderr [\-l | \-s] \fISTDERR_FILE\fR
.RS 4
Use the file named by
\fISTDERR_FILE\fR
as the destination for the standard error of the job\&. If the
\fB\-l\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the
\fB\-s\fR
option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x \fIRSL_CLAUSE\fR
.RS 4
Add a set of custom RSL attributes described by
\fIRSL_CLAUSE\fR
to the job description\&. The clause must be an RSL conjunction and may contain one or more attributes\&. This can be used to include attributes which can not be defined by other command\-line options of
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l | \-s
.RS 4
When included outside the context of
\fB\-stdin\fR,
\fB\-stdout\fR, or
\fB\-stderr\fR
command\-line options,
\fB\-l\fR
and
\fB\-s\fR
alter the interpretation of the executable path\&. If the
\fB\-l\fR
option is specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the
\fB\-s\fR
option is specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on the file system where
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
.RE

\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR\&.
