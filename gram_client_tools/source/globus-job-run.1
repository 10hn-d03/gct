.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
program constructs a job description from its command\-line options and then submits the job to the GRAM service running at
\fISERVICE_CONTACT\fR\&. The executable and arguments to the executable are provided on the command\-line after all other options\&. Note that the
\fB\-dumprsl\fR,
\fB\-dryrun\fR,
\fB\-verify\fR, and
\fB\-file\fR
command\-line options must occur before the first non\-option argument, the
\fISERVICE_CONTACT\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fBglobus\-job\-run\fR
provides similar functionality to
\fBglobusrun\fR
in that it allows interactive start\-up of GRAM jobs\&. However, unlike
\fBglobusrun\fR, it uses command\-line parameters to define the job instead of RSL expressions\&.

T{
\-help | \-usage
T}:T{
.sp
Display a help message to standard error and exit\&.
T}
T{
\-version
T}:T{
.sp
Display the software version of the \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR program to standard output\&.
T}
T{

T}:T{
.sp
Display the software version of the \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR program including DiRT information to standard output\&.
T}
T{
\-dumprsl
T}:T{
.sp
Translate the command\-line options to \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR into an RSL expression that can be used with tools such as \fBglobusrun\fR\&.
T}
T{
\-dryrun
T}:T{
.sp
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the dryrun option enabled\&. When this option is used, the GRAM service prepares to execute the job but stops before submitting the job to the LRM\&. This can be used to diagnose some problems such as missing files\&.
T}
T{
\-verify
T}:T{
.sp
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the dryrun option enabled and then without it enabled if the dryrun is successful\&.
T}
T{
\-file \fIARGUMENT_FILE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Read additional command\-line options from \fIARGUMENT_FILE\fR\&.
T}
T{
\-np \fIPROCESSES\fR | \-count \fIPROCESSES\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Start \fIPROCESSES\fR instances of the executable as a single job\&.
T}
T{
\-m \fIMAX_TIME\fR | \-maxtime \fIMAX_TIME\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Schedule the job to run for a maximum of \fIMAX_TIME\fR minutes\&.
T}
T{
\-p \fIPROJECT\fR | \-project \fIPROJECT\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Request that the job use the allocation \fIPROJECT\fR when submitting the job to the LRM\&.
T}
T{
\-q \fIQUEUE\fR | \-queue \fIQUEUE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Request that the job be submitted to the LRM using the named \fIQUEUE\fR\&.
T}
T{
\-d \fIDIRECTORY\fR | \-directory \fIDIRECTORY\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Run the job in the directory named by \fIDIRECTORY\fR\&. Input and output files will be interpreted relative to this directory\&. This directory must exist on the file system on the LRM\-managed resource\&. If not specified, the job will run in the home directory of the user the job is running as\&.
T}
T{
\-env \fINAME\fR=\fIVALUE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Define an environment variable named by \fINAME\fR with the value \fIVALUE\fR in the job environment\&. This option may be specified multiple times to define multiple environment variables\&.
T}
T{
\-stdin [\-l | \-s] \fISTDIN_FILE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Use the file named by \fISTDIN_FILE\fR as the standard input of the job\&. If the \fB\-l\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the \fB\-s\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
T}
T{
\-stdout [\-l | \-s] \fISTDOUT_FILE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Use the file named by \fISTDOUT_FILE\fR as the destination for the standard output of the job\&. If the \fB\-l\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the \fB\-s\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
T}
T{
\-stderr [\-l | \-s] \fISTDERR_FILE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Use the file named by \fISTDERR_FILE\fR as the destination for the standard error of the job\&. If the \fB\-l\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the \fB\-s\fR option is specified, then this file is interpreted to be on the file system where \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
T}
T{
\-x \fIRSL_CLAUSE\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Add a set of custom RSL attributes described by \fIRSL_CLAUSE\fR to the job description\&. The clause must be an RSL conjunction and may contain one or more attributes\&. This can be used to include attributes which can not be defined by other command\-line options of \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR\&.
T}
T{
\-l | \-s
T}:T{
.sp
When included outside the context of \fB\-stdin\fR, \fB\-stdout\fR, or \fB\-stderr\fR command\-line options, \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-s\fR alter the interpretation of the executable path\&. If the \fB\-l\fR option is specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM\&. If the \fB\-s\fR option is specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on the file system where \fBglobus\-job\-run\fR is being executed, and the file will be staged via GASS\&. If neither is specified, the local behavior is assumed\&.
