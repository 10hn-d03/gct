; prompting if it is not present.

[Endpoint]

; Name of the endpoint. Can be either user#name or name, but if the former,
; the user must match [GlobusOnline] User above
; The special value %(SHORT_HOSTNAME)s will substitute the non-qualified
; portion of an ec2 instance's public hostname, falling back to the
; non-qualified hostname portion of the machine's nodename
Name = %(SHORT_HOSTNAME)s

; True or False, determining if the endpoint will be public or private.

[Security]

; If this is true, then use the relay.globusonline.org to generate
; a random service credential so that Globus Online can access this service. 
; Otherwise, GCMU will assume the Certificate and Key have been 
; generated by some other method.
; Note that FetchCredentialFromRelay will only work if the 
FetchCredentialFromRelay = True

; If FetchCredentialsFromRelay is True, and the fetch conditions are met,

; Authorization method. The default is MyProxyGridmapCallout
;    MyProxyGridmapCallout:
;        use an authorization callout which matches the CN of the certificate
;        signed by a MyProxy certificate to a local user account. This is
;        most useful when using the PamLogin configuration of MyProxy to
;        generate user proxies from their login credential
;    CILogon:
;        use an authorization callout which matches the ePPN extension of
;        a certificate generated by the CILogon CA to a local user account.
;        To choose the identity which is allowed to generate those credentials,
;        you must also set the CILogonIdentityProvider attribute below.

; A comma separated list of full paths that clients may access.  Each path may
; be prefixed by R and/or W, denoting read or write access, or N to explicitly
; deny access to a path.  If a given path is a directory, all contents and
; subdirectories will be given the same access.  Order of paths does not matter
; -- the permissions on the longest matching path will apply.  The special
; character '~' will be replaced by the authenticated user's home directory,
; and * may be used for simple wildcard matching.
; By default all paths are allowed, and access control is handled by the OS.
; Examples:
; Allow read access to /data and full access to the user's home directory:
; RestrictPaths = RW~,R/data
; Allow full access to the home directory, but deny hidden files there:
; RestrictPaths = RW~,N~/.*
