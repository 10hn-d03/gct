; creating or modifying an endpoint.
[GlobusOnline]

; GlobusOnline user name.
; By default, this will use the value of the GLOBUSONINE_USER environment
; variable, or if it's not set, it will prompt for it when needed.
;; User = %(GLOBUSONLINE_USER)s

; GlobusOnline login password.
; By default, this will use the value of the GLOBUSONINE_PASSWORD environment
; variable, or if it's not set, prompt.

; Set these if you want to add or modify the core attributes of the endpoint.
[Endpoint]

; Name of the endpoint. Can be either user#name or name, but if the former,
; the user must match [GlobusOnline] User above
; By default, the short hostname will be the current machine's node name
;; Name = %(SHORT_HOSTNAME)s

; True or False, determining if the endpoint will be public or private.
; If not specified, this will default to False (non-public).

; These are the default service security settings, for services which will be
; accessed from Globus Online (GridFTP and MyProxy). 
; There can be an override in the GridFTP or MyProxy sections below. 
[Security]

; If this is true, then use the relay.globusonline.org to generate
; a random service credential so that Globus Online can access this service. 
; Otherwise, GCMU will assume the Certificate and Key have been 
; generated by some other method.
; Note that FetchCredentialsFromRelay will only work if the 
; Globus Online [Endpoint] Name is defined above, does not exist
; already, and only one GridFTP server is being configured to use the
; service credential.
FetchCredentialsFromRelay = True

; Path to the certificate.
; If FetchCredentialsFromRelay is True, and the fetch conditions are met,
; this CertificateFile value will be overwritten. 
; If not specified, this will default to /etc/gcmu/grid-security/hostcert.pem
;; CertificateFile = /etc/gcmu/grid-security/hostcert.pem

; If FetchCredentialsFromRelay is True, and the fetch conditions are met,

;; KeyFile = /etc/gcmu/grid-security/hostkey.pem

; Path to where the trusted certificate directory. The
; GlobusOnline Relay CA will be installed there, as well as the MyProxy
; trust roots if the MyProxy server is running elsewhere. 
; If not specified, this will default to /etc/gcmu/grid-security/certificates
;; TrustedCertificateDirectory = /etc/gcmu/grid-security/certificates

; Authorization method. The default is MyProxyGridmapCallout
;    Gridmap:
;        use the gridmap file whose path is in the [Security]/GridmapFile
;        configuration option
;    MyProxyGridmapCallout:
;        use an authorization callout which matches the CN of the certificate
;        signed by a MyProxy certificate to a local user account. This is
;        most useful when using the PamLogin configuration of MyProxy to
;        generate user proxies from their login credential
;    CILogon:
;        use an authorization callout which matches the ePPN extension of
;        a certificate generated by the CILogon CA to a local user account.
;        To choose the identity which is allowed to generate those credentials,
;        you must also set the CILogonIdentityProvider attribute below.
